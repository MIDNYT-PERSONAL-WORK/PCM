## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

Concept for PAM Logistics & Delivery
Headers
● Order number- IDs unique to every customer
● Customer Details- name & phone contact
● Product- name of product
● Operator- call centre personnel that handles assigned customers
● Delivery date- Day customer is placing order
● Location- Detailed directions from customer about location
● City - The capital regions where customers location is found
● Status- Final buyout of product whether delivered,postponed,cancelled or travelled
● Rider- Particular delivery person/company assigned to product
● Amount- Total amount paid for each product
● Delivery fee- Amount charged for delivery
ADS
Mainly facebook ads,targeted audiences should be able to see the link and be redirected to our
main page/ use the link directly to the page where the detailed write up shows to place their
order.
Ads(-image/video) These images and videos will be detailed and persuasive to not only get
customers attention but to also close a purchase, phrases like ;free delivery, discounted when
you get more than 1 is inculcated in the ads
For products that are supplements, some ingredients and their uses can be listed,videos talking
extensively about those products can also be uploaded to support videos and images of actual
products.
Product name,price ,weight and packaging style will be displayed
Free delivery, upsell prices leading to discounts.
CONCEPT
Building a system where ads will be posted with SEOs to targeted audiences
The uploads will be informative videos and pictures talking about the products,its uses
as well.
There's a link beneath the ad directing you to click to buy
There’s more info about product on the page then the form to fill for your name and contact
The link leads to a sheet with a part to fill for name,phone number,price of product and
upsell details.
These details must be easily accessible to the operator so he/she can do a follow up call
to the customer.
When an operator talks to a customer, the order status is confirmed. If the customer
agrees for delivery to be made, (delivery is done the same day or next day) order will be
dispatched to the delivery person. A one- time code will be sent to the customer to input
after delivery is done.
With instances where customers will be using a proxy a similar code will be shared with
the proxy as well.
VENDORS- Merchants whose products are being posted on the platform. The vendor’s name
,email,phone contact, location and status will be needed as well.
INVENTORY-Product quantity received from vendor
Product quantity with delivery
